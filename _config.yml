  This is a test Jekyll site. I wish to test out a new template setup.
  Also, I wish to test out pagination on this site, as well as,
  setting up a multi blog (potentially with pagination and RSS working on each).
baseurl: "/jekyll-test-site" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "ivanaGDI.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  jekyll

# Build settings

sass:
  sass_dir: css/_sass

# Pagination
paginate: 5
paginate_path: "blog/:num"

# Gems
gems: [jekyll-paginate, jekyll-gist, jekyll-coffeescript]
